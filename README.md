projetos java script. Html e css automaticamente jรก feitos sem mim. 
java script projects. html and css already done without me. 

The purpose of that repose is to practice javaScript and learn the functionalities of a basic website. I always tried to do on my own without the creator's instructions because i wanted to do my research to get the job done and not just following the steps. At the final, i could change something in the project without any tutorial. It's a simple thing, but it made the difference for me because i could finally understand the purpose and how and when you have to do a certain method. Follow my projects on git and see my improvements. Bye
